# UwU-fy
Tuwn youw Discowd sewvew into a SUGOI UwU sewvew! Discord Hack Week 2019 entry.

## Setup
* Install dependencies
  * `npm install`
* Run tests
  * `npm run test`
* Run production
  * `npm run start`
* Additional requirements
  * The app requires a `DICORD_BOT_TOKEN` environment variable in order to work. This will depend on the patform you're deploying, but the simplest way to do this is to make a `.env` file. Inside the file, type `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=<token>` where `<token>` is the token of your discord bot.
 
## How To Use
The bot needs __Manage Messages__ permission in order to work properly. 
The bot works by taking all messages that it reads, UwUfying them, then deleting the original message.
To enable UwUfy on a channel, just add an `uwu` to the channel that you want ~~to destroy~~ the bot to run on. 
It will only convert incoming messages, it cannot convert the rest of the message history.
To UwUfy a message outside of an UwU channel, just add an `uwu dis` before your message.

You can also invite the bot on your own server through [here](https://discordapp.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=594050328740102146&permissions=305152&scope=bot). (Do note that I might not be able to run this bot indefinitely)
