## How To Use
The bot needs __Manage Messages__ permission in order to work properly. 
The bot works by taking all messages that it reads, UwUfying them, then deleting the original message.
To enable UwUfy on a channel, just add an `uwu` to the channel that you want ~~to destroy~~ the bot to run on. 
It will only convert incoming messages, it cannot convert the rest of the message history.
To UwUfy a message outside of an UwU channel, just add an `uwu dis` before your message.
